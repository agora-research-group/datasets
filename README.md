## Datasets

### 1. [Mining Rainfall Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Twitter: A Temporal Approach](https://github.com/agora-research-group/datasets/tree/master/AGILE2017)

The AGILE 2017 is a raw dataset of rainfall gauges and tweets that are openly available in CSV format. This dataset was published at the 20th AGILE Conference through the paper Mining Rainfall Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Twitter: A Temporal Approach.

### 2. [Geo-social media as a proxy for hydrometeorological data for streamflow estimation and to improve flood monitoring](https://github.com/agora-research-group/datasets/tree/master/C&G017)

The C&G 2017 is a raw dataset of rainfall gauges and tweets that are openly available in CSV format. This dataset was published at the Computers & Geosciences through the paper Geo-social media as a proxy for hydrometeorological data for streamflow estimation and to improve flood monitoring.[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.10.010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.10.010)
